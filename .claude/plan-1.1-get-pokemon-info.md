# Refactoring
- [ ] Improve deserialization in the PokedexApiServerSimulator and the PokedexApiServer and clearly separate the assertions (maybe they can share some code?)

# TODO
- [ ] FakePokemonRepository to be fully implemented (also unhappy path)
- [ ] FakePokemonRepository to run against contract tests
- [ ] Implement HttpPokemonRepository
